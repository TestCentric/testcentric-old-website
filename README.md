**This is the archived original source code for our website, developed using Wyam.
It has now been replaced with an implementation in Statiq, available in
repository `testcentric-statiq-website`.**

# TestCentric Website

This is the source code for the TestCentric website, which is deployed
at `https://testcentric.github.io`. Originally, the source code was
in the `develop` branch of the `testcentric.github.io` repository.

However, since the site is generated statically using `Wyam`, there is
actually no need to have the source and the static output in the same repo.
In fact, separating the two makes things much cleaner.

At the moment (18 Dec 2020) this repo only contains the source of the
home page and header for the overall TestCentric site. There is separate
source for the two current TestCentric products, the TestCentric GUI and
the TcLite framework, in  their respective repositories. The plan is to 
migrate each of them to this repo.
